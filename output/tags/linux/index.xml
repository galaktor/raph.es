&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather quiet over the past months and I&amp;rsquo;m sure the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; blogosphere was shocked and wants to know why. Well, in addition to holidays and the likes, for the probably 4th time in the past 15 years I am attempting to move my computing life from Windows into Linux. And since I rarely have much time for my geeky side projects, I have been dedicating it to that rather than the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As just mentioned I tried this a few times before, but eventually failed. First time around I failed to even get my CD-ROM drive mounted in SuSe. Later on Ubuntu I lacked a few critical tools for my studies, like OneNote (which is brilliant) or VisualStudio for my thesis project. And Call of Duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s different now?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned two things that I hope to get right this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is that I need to move most, if not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my computing tasks into just one OS. Anything else will cause too much friction workflow-wise and I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually get stuck on Windows again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other lesson was that Windows is simply best for two things I care somewhat about: .NET development and gaming. And since neither of these play well inside a VM I&amp;rsquo;ll need to dual-boot. The good thing (in this context) is that these two points have become less important to me over the last years. I do .NET in my day job, so I rarely feel the need to continue at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as much as it hurts to admit: I&amp;rsquo;ve outgrown my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/11-signs-you-re-no-longer-a-hard-core-gamer-329291&#34;&gt;hardcore gamer phase&lt;/a&gt;. Gaming is now something I do on a work-less, shave-less, spongebob-boxer-shorts days. But I&amp;rsquo;m determined to finish all those games I bought during the last few X-mas sales on Steam! I suppose that puts me into some form of mid-life crisis? Scary, how gaming was close to the center of my life at a time when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really afford the games I wanted. Now I have enough &amp;ldquo;allowance&amp;rdquo;, but barely any time left to play games. Oh, the irony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, at the end of the day, I can now probably live with booting up Windows for these things as they are rather rare events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Stick with Windows, idiot!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Linux at all then, you might ask? Well first of all I have been doing professional .NET development for over 7 years now (albeit not exclusively) and feel very comfortable in Windows, VS and the likes. But feeling too comfortable is a bad sign, it means not learning very much. So while .NET will stay a good way to do cool stuff and earn a nice living, I feel the nerdy (read: masochist) urge to leave the comfort zone and learn new things. You know, things that make me feel like a first-grader again. That make me yell curses at the screen. That make me feel like a god after I do get them working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, and this is a big one: I think &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fsf.org/&#34;&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; is important. In a time where most of our daily life depends on computers that sit in virtually everybody&amp;rsquo;s pocket, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to have as much control over them as possible. Linux not only gives you very much that control, it&amp;rsquo;s also arguably the best operating system out there. Many distros nowadays work out-of-the-box with WiFi and all the gimmicks. So really I see no reason why I should have to force my life into a proprietary operating system while I can get a better, more flexible and &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; one for&amp;hellip;well, free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;#!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I did was upgrade my good old &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviews.cnet.com/Dell_XPS_M1530/4505-3121_7-32778979.html&#34;&gt;M1530&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s RAM, back up my files&amp;hellip;.and do other things so boring that just writing about them makes me narcoleptic. So pardon me if I skip to the good parts. I stuck roughly to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iceflatline.com/2011/05/install-and-configure-crunchbang-linux-on-the-lenovo-t410-laptop/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; excellent tutorial, which served me as a guideline although I did deviate a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed Windows 7 as a primary OS using about 50% of the HDD, and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://crunchbanglinux.org/&#34;&gt;Crunchbang&lt;/a&gt; into dedicated partitions using the rest. Crunchbang is a minimalistic yet fully featured distro based on Debian Squeeze. I let the boot loader Grub2 install itself at the beginning of the disk. In CB I had to run the command &lt;code&gt;update-grub&lt;/code&gt; so that the OS-prober could auto-detect Windows, then that was sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m moving into the brave new world of WTF&amp;rsquo;ing on Linux I will post about things I have learned along the way. One is the ability to use several window managers and select them at the login screen. The default on CB is &lt;a href=&#34;http://openbox.org/&#34;&gt;Openbox&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s great, but I&amp;rsquo;d like a mouse-less window manager for coding. Thus coming soon are my notes on how to get Openbox and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/&#34;&gt;Ratpoison&lt;/a&gt; to co-exist. (This is also a prime example of why proprietary software can lock you down - there&amp;rsquo;s no nice way to change your window management on Windows. On Linux, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, you can always roll your own.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, there will still be Windows/.NET related posts in the future - we&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see how &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; attempt at Linux will work out for me.&lt;/p&gt;

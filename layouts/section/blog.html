    <p>The below are old posts from when I used Blogger more of less actively a few years ago. I cringe a bit when I read them for various reasons. I'll leave them here as a reminder of how much I have (or have not) grown since. Just be aware that these posts are several years old and as a result might contain broken links.</p>

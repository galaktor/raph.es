I was a geek before it was cool. By day I pretend to be a grown-up and most of the time people fall for it. I get paid to beat up computers until they do what other people want them to do.

On this humble website, I braindump the things that occupy my brain during the rare moments I find for myself.

# Frequently asked questions
## How's it going?
Great.

## Did you see the game last night?
Nope.

## Any plans for the weekend?
Nope.

# *Rarely* asked questions
...because they are much more interesting than their frequent counterparts.

## What's your Myer-Briggs score?
INTP.

## What's your opinion on Myer-Briggs scores?
I buy into the introvert-extrovert spectrum, but the rest is too dynamic for anyone to have a meaningful score. Companies like MB because it puts people into convenient little boxes.

## Why does your website look so weird?
Thanks! I'll take an internet full of weird, imperfect, but *self-made* websites with character over the flood of Wordpress templates and Facebook pages any day. Believe it or not, this page looks just how I want it to. You can read about it in the [project description](/project/website).

## Why won't you eat this sugarlicious cake I made you? You're hurting my feelings!
I'm sincerely sorry. But just like your and my ancestors, I live on a ketogenic diet, which means effectively zero sugar, starch and wheat. If I did eat your cake, the insulin spike that would follow would probably send me into a coma. Or at least make me feel really terrible. Because - in case you didn't know - people didn't evolve to eat stuff like that. Go ahead if you like, but I'll respectfully pass.

## You never eat cake?! You poor, poor thing!
Gee, thanks! But I'm good. I've got some great sugar-free and wheat-free cake recipes. You should try them some time! Also, I just ate a five egg omelette with bacon and mascarpone. And later I might eat peanut butter straigt out of the jar, with a big fat spoon and whipped cream on top. Life has it's moments.

## Are you out of your mind? All that fat is going to kill you!
Nah. In case you didn't know, our bodies have evolved over millions of years of consuming mainly animal fats and some protein. From my point of view, most of the western world is on some kind of high-carbohydrate, glycogenic diet fad. Evolution and biochemistry got my back on this one.

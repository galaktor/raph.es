I was a geek before it was cool. By day I pretend to be a grown-up and most of the time people fall for it. I get paid to beat up computers until they do what other people want them to do.

On this humble website, I braindump the things that occupy my brain during the rare moments I find for myself.

# Frequently asked questions
## How's it going?
Great.

## Did you see the game last night?
Nope.

## Any plans for the weekend?
Nope.

# *Rarely* asked questions
...because they are much more interesting than their frequent counterparts.

## What's your Myer-Briggs score?
INTP.

## What's your opinion on Myer-Briggs scores?
I buy into the introvert-extrovert spectrum, but the rest is too dynamic for anyone to have a meaningful score. Companies like MB because it puts people into convenient little boxes.

## Why does your website look so weird?
Thanks! I'll take an internet full of weird, imperfect, but *self-made* websites with character over the flood of Wordpress templates and Facebook pages any day. Believe it or not, this page looks just how I want it to. You can read about it in the [project description](/project/website).

## Here, have some cake!
That's not a question. And thanks, but I will not and cannot take in carbohydrates such as those found in sugar, flour and starch. I have long and strong opinions on the subject, but the gist of it is: they make most people fat and even more people sick (eventually). Thanks for the offer, though!

## Did you just order tea at this bar?
Yes, I did. See, I don't drink alcohol. Not just because alcoholic drinks are typically full of carbs which will make me ill. But also because it's unhealthy, expensive, slows me down and makes me dumb.

## Are you a hippy and/or straight-edge fundamentalist?
Maybe! But you make that sound like it's a bad thing.

Just ask yourself how you know what you think you know about, well, anything. But especially things you recall to have "known" all your life, i.e. things you learned as a child from family and teachers.

In what you could call my personal little renaissance I began to revisit subjects which I had taken for granted all my life, including (but not limited to) religion, diet and habits I had adopted by imitating my environment. Like that bread and oatmeal are supposed to be healthy, but watch out for them eggs! Or how you have to eat every little bit that was put onto your plate. Or how cool people drink beer when they go out. Even little things like how I tie my shoes (note to self: blog material right there).

This process is ongoing and far from over. I do some things different than most people around me, but I consider that to be a good thing. You should try it sometime ;-)

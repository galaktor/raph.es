I was a geek before it was cool. I pretend to be a grown-up. Most of the time people seem to believe it. By day, I get paid to shout at computers until they do what other people want them to do. By night I often sleep or (preferably) try to make *stuff*.

On this humble website, I dump the things which occupy my brain-cycles during the rare moments I find any to be idle.


# Frequently asked questions
TODO RAPH: MOVE SOME OF THIS INTO BLOG POSTS AND LINK THEM

## How's it going?
Great.

## Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
[Nope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWJIQm9qH-w).

## Any plans for the weekend?
Nope.

# *Rarely* asked questions
...because they are much more interesting than their frequent counterparts.

## What happened to your old Blogger blog?
I didn't like Blogger for a number or reasons, and snapped into using Twitter almost overnight. Now I control over my content back and prefer static website generation combined with free web hosting. Read more [here](/blog/2000/01/todo/).

MOVE
For a while, I blogged fairly frequently, which for me means once or twice a month. I even had a few minutes in the sun when the odd post hit Hacker News. That all stopped the moment I discovered Twitter.

Twitter gave me a convenient tool to rant, dump my thoughts in bite-size chunks and perpetuate cool things I found on the interwebs. The simplicity of use compared to writing and re-writing a blog entry for days just kept me from blogging at all.

## So, why a new blog?
I am not enrirely happy with Twitter. For one, there's the limitation of 140 characters per Tweet - which I often find to be a useful limitation that forces me to get creative. But also the fact that Twitter owns their platform and therefor controls my content does not agree with my personal philosophy. With my own blog, I control it all, on my own domain.

I found a better solution in static website generation (via Hugo) and hosting by NeoCities. It solves problems I had with Blogger in the first place, namely: * tedious WYSIWYG editing * always-on requirement * Google's tentacles all over it * limited control over layout and design

## What's your Myers-Briggs score?
IXXX.

## X isn't a valid value for a MB score.
I buy into the introvert-extrovert spectrum, but the rest is too dynamic for anyone to have a meaningful score. Companies like Myers-Briggs because it puts people into convenient little boxes.

## Why does your website look so weird?
Thanks! I'll take an internet full of weird, imperfect, but *self-made* websites with character over the flood of Wordpress templates and Facebook pages any day. Believe it or not, this page looks just how I want it to. You can read about it in the [project description](/project/website).

## Here, have some cake!
Thanks again, but I will not and cannot take in carbohydrates such as those found in sugar, flour and starch. I have long and strong opinions on the subject, but the gist of it is: they make most people fat and even more people sick (eventually). Thanks for the offer, though!

## Did you just order tea at this bar?
Yes, I did. See, I don't drink alcohol. Read more [here](/blog/2000/01/alcohol/).

## Are you some kind of straight-edge fundamentalist?
Maybe! But you make that sound like it's a bad thing. Read more [here](/blog/2000/01/todo/).

MOVE
Just ask yourself how you know what you think you know about... well, anything. But especially things you recall to have "known" all your life, i.e. things you learned as a child from family and teachers. When we're young, we absorb and accept "facts" like a sponge. But many aren't factual at all, we just copy them from our environment and foget about them. From a basic evolutionary point of view, this is useful behavior. But we can do better.

In what you could call my personal little renaissance I began to revisit subjects which I had taken for granted all my life, including (but not limited to) religion, diet and habits I had adopted by imitating my environment. Like that bread and oatmeal are supposed to be healthy, but watch out for them eggs! Or how you have to eat every little bit that was put onto your plate, even if you're not hungry. Or how cool people drink beer when they go out. Even when and how I tie my shoes (note to self: blog material right there).

This process is ongoing and far from over. I do some things different than most people around me, but I consider that to be a good thing. You should try it sometime ;-)

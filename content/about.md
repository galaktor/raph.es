I was a geek before it was cool. By day I pretend to be a grown-up and most of the time people fall for it. I get paid to beat up computers until they do what other people want them to do.

On this humble website, I braindump the things that occupy my brain during the rare moments I find for myself.

# Frequently asked questions
## How's it going?
Great.

## Did you see the game last night?
Nope.

## Any plans for the weekend?
Nope.

# *Rarely* asked questions
...because they are much more interesting than their frequent counterparts.

## What's your Myer-Briggs score?
INTP.

## What's your opinion on Myer-Briggs scores?
I buy into the introvert-extrovert spectrum, but the rest is too dynamic for anyone to have a meaningful score. Companies like MB because it puts people into convenient little boxes.

## Why does your website look so weird?
Thanks! I'll take an internet full of weird, imperfect, but *self-made* websites with character over the flood of Wordpress templates and Facebook pages any day. Believe it or not, this page looks just how I want it to. You can read about it in the [project description](/project/website).

## Here, have some cake!
That's not a question. And thanks, but I will not and cannot take in carbohydrates such as those found in sugar, flour and starch. I have long and strong opinions on the subject, but the gist of it is: they make most people fat and even more people sick (eventually). Thanks for the offer, though!

## Did you just order tea at this bar?
Yes, I did. See, I don't drink alcohol. Not just because alcoholic drinks are typically full of carbs which will make me ill. But also because it's unhealthy, expensive, slows me down and makes me dumb.

## Are you a hippy and/or straight-edge fundamentalist?
You make that sound like a bad thing. Maybe. [They](http://reason.com/archives/2012/12/24/half-the-facts-you-know-are-probably-wro) say "half the facts you know are probably wrong":

> "Facts are being manufactured all of the time, and (...) many of them turn out to be wrong. Checking each one is how the scientific process is supposed to work."

> "**There simply is no substitute for skepticism.**"

Just ask yourself how you know what you think you know about, well, anything. But especially things you seem to have "known" all your life, i.e. things you learned as a child from family and teachers. In what you could call my personal little renaissance I began to revisit subjects which I had taken for granted all my life, including but not limited to religion, diet and habits I had adopted by imitating my environment. Even little things like how I tie my shoes (note to self: blog material right there). This process is ongoing and far from over. I do some things different than most people around me, but I consider that to be a good thing. You should try it sometime ;-)

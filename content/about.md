On this humble website, I dump the things which occupy my brain-cycles on the rare occasion where I find the time to do so.

# Frequently asked questions
## How's it going?
Great.

## Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
[Nope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWJIQm9qH-w).

## Any plans for the weekend?
Nope.

# *Rarely* asked questions
...because small talk is boring.

## What happened to your old Blogger blog?
I didn't like Blogger for a number or reasons, and snapped into using [Twitter](https://twitter.com/estraph) almost overnight. I didn't blog for about two years. Now I am taking back ownership over my content. Read more [here](/blog/2014/10/new-beginning/).

## What's your Myers-Briggs score?
[IXXX](/blog/2014/10/intp/).

## Why does your website look so weird?
Thanks! Believe it or not, this page looks just how I want it to. You can read about that in the [project description](/project/website). I'll take an internet of weird websites with personality over today's flood of look-a-like Wordpress themes and bland Facebook profiles any day. 

## Would you like some cake?
Sorry, but I [avoid](/blog/2014/10/lchf/) dietary carbohydrate like the plague that it is. Thanks for the offer, though!.

## kk. Can I bring you a beer?
Cheers, but I'll pass. I don't drink [alcohol](/blog/2014/10/alcohol/).

## Woah, are you some kind of straight-edge fundamentalist?
No! Maybe! You make that sound like it's a bad thing. Read more [here](/blog/2014/10/personal-renaissance).

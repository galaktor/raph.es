Here's a little recipe I use to bake breads and cakes without any flour. The below describes the base which results in a bread-like loaf. By adding spices or sweetener or whatever you like you can easily modify it to your taste, including sweet cake or muffins by throwing in your sweetener of choice.

Most recipes for "low carb bread" you will find online try to be high in protein but low in fat. This here is my adaptation which is still medium to high in protein but also has a high fat content.

# Base Ingredients
* 8-10 eggs
* 100+ml whipping cream
* 100+g butter
* 20+g coconut oil
* 150+g various ground nuts and/or seeds (see below)
* 20g psyllium husks

# Optional Ingredients
* 100+g Xylitol (optional, for sweet bread or cakes)
* Protein powder
* Peanut butter, or other nut butters
* Cocoa (powder or chunks)
* One or more shots of espresso
* Berries
* Salt, spices, tiny splash of vinegar (for bread variety)
* Grated cheese
* Fried onions
* Bits of tomato
* Avocado
* ...your imagination is the limit

# Preparation
Mix it all together, starting with the molten butter, eggs and cream. Add the nuts and other ingredients. You will know that the ratio of ingredients is right when the dough is a firm goo - I prefer it to still wobble and move a bit. Be careful to not make it too sticky, especially if you're working with protein powder. 

Pour into pan lined with baking paper (or form buns with thicker dough if that's what you're going for). Stick into preheated oven at around 160 degrees Celsius.

When the dough heats during baking, it will soften and flow together - that's perfect for the pan, but if you want little buns and want to prevent them from becoming one large goop then make the dough stiffer. 

Bake four at least 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it every five minutes or so. Duration in oven will depend on how liquid your dough was and how high your pan is. For my pan it's usually a bit more than 20 mins.

Once you poke the dough and see that nothing sticks you can turn off the oven and let it stand in the remaining heat until the oven cools.

## Output size
The exact amounts depend on the size of your baking pan. I usually use a tray about 3cm deep, lined with baking paper (I prefer the re-usable silicon variant). The below makes a full oven-wide and oven-deep tray of about 2-3cm high bread/cake. You will have to try and tweak to get optimal results. 

## Regarding the nuts
The eggs and nuts are what give the bread it's form. I use different nuts every time - whatever is around the kitchen - but they should be mostly ground (not necessarily to a flour, although that can help). You can buy them pre-ground or throw them into a food processor and gring yourself - the sky is the limit. Seeds also absorb water so they can help make the bread firm. Leave some chunky bits in if you like that. Here are just some of the things I typically throw in (mostly ground)
* flax seed
* coconut (dessicated or flour)
* chia seeds (whole)
* pumpkin seeds
* sunflower seeds
* sesame seeds
* peanuts
* macadamia nuts
* brazil nuts
* psyllium husks

## Protein powder
You can get good results when using protein powder to stiffen up the dough but I tend to use it lightly to not at all, nuts taste better and work fine. For smaller loafs and bread buns you might want to experiment with bigger amounts of protein powder, it helps a lot. Just make sure to get some that tastes neutral and is low in carbs, but high in protein and not full of sugar or other weird chemicals.

I am a model *introvert*.

The term is often misunderstood. *I* didn't even understand it until recently when I read [Quiet](http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/) by *Susan Cain*. I recommend you read it to. Because while I want to describe what being an introvert means for me, this book does a much better job at describing it's meaning in a more general sense.

So here's a loose bag of things I associate with being an introvert. Some might not be exclusively limited to introversion, but sit under the same umbrella as far as *I'm* concerned. Take it with the usual grain of sceptical salt.

## I prefer deep conversations over superficial *blah*.
Small talk drives me mad. It's a game I hate to play, and the English speaking cultures in particular seem to love playing it.

Talk about real things, or don't talk at all. Don't ask me "How are you?" unless you want a real answer. I'm absolutely ok if you don't ask me anything at all. *Mingling* is a nightmarish activity. A superficial, meaningless exchange of words that doesn't give me anything, but costs all my energy.

Attention: It's nothing personal! You're probably a great person, really. I just don't want to be around people sometimes.

## Silence is great.
That awkward silence when people don't know what to say? I'm fine with that. It's only awkward if I think that you think that I think that you should be saying something... It's ok to not talk unless there's something to talk about. There's no need to fill a few minutes in the hallway/elevator/train with chit-chat about weather or some sports event.

A few minutes of silence is great. It might be just what I need to recharge a bit. Or to think about that thing I've been thinking about...

## Staying at home is ok.
People who like to stay at home are usually thought of as anti-social. Well, I prefer being at home doing whatever over going outside to socialize. Even when it's sunny outside, I might feel *zero* obligation to go outside and do whatever it is people do in the park or at the beach.

## Going to a pub is a chore.
Some people can spend night after night socializing with countless others in pubs, bars, discos. I'd rather hang out and have dinner with a select few. Or by myself, with a good movie or book or so. Or a soldering iron.

## I am *not* shy.
I am a pretty good team player, and I have absolutely no problem stepping in front of people and presenting things. Quite the opposite, I enjoy it most of the time - and I've been told I'm actually quite good at it. I just need to recharge at some point - by having some space for myself.

## I hate context switching.
I am best when I can focus on one thing at a time, properly. Multi-tasking is a myth, and even more so for introverts. Do one thing properly instead of many things badly.

## Fueled by curiousity.
When I get curious about a subject I wish to learn more about, I can get obsessed with it. It's all that's on my mind for a period of time. Weeks. Maybe months during which I absorb whatever I can, as fast as I can.

Eventually I move onto something else that catches my interest, and drop that previous thing like a hot potato - just to switch back to the former sometime later. Remember, I don't like multi-tasking. I can be best and most efficient when zooming in on one thing only.

Don't get me wrong, I can do other stuff, too. I pull my own weight on projects which don't happen to fall into my current topic of interest. But on those projects that capture my curiosity, my imagination... those where I feel I can learn new things, explore new territory... at those, I excel.

## I might take longer to do something

## OCD

## Ticks

## 

# The bottom line
In practice it means I avoid big social get-togethers. I probably won't talk to you in the elevator. I pull my own weight on everyday tasks, but *excel* at work that interests me.

I used to think I'm a weird loner. Maybe a bit down the autistic spectrum. This is because the visible part of society is made up of extroverts, who perpetuate extrovert ideals. Introverts are alll over the place, they're just not typically in the foreground.

Reading about introverts really helped me accept what I am.

According to the terminology established by the late psychologist Carl Jung, I am introverted.

I know this because I took a test. It was part of a three day course for work. We all did a short *Myers-Briggs* test and got four numbers in the end. Each number then tells you where you sit on the four linear scales. The scale is basically cut in half and if you fall on the low side, you are mapped to one letter. Fall on the other side, you're the other letter.

The end result is four letters, one from each scale. You combine them to get your *Myers-Briggs score*.

# I got `INTP`.
* `I` Introverted
* `N` something
* `T` something
* `P` something

You read that right. I can't remember what the other stuff meant, because the only convincing bit was the first letter. The other three were so utterly unconvincing that I didn't bother to remember them.

My main beef with those last ones being that they were so vaguely defined, you could give people either result and they'd go "wow that's just like me!".

I buy into the introvert-extrovert spectrum, but the rest is too dynamic for anyone to have a meaningful score. Companies like Myers-Briggs because it puts people into convenient little boxes.

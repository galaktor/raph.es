I am an *introvert*.

I know this because I took a test. It was part of a three day course for work. We all did a short *Myers-Briggs* test and got four numbers in the end. Each number then tells you where you sit on four linear scales. Each scale is split through the middle and - depending on which half your number falls on - you get one of two letters per scale.

The resulting four letters combine to form your *Myers-Briggs Type Indicator* (MBTI). By knowing someone's MBTI, you're supposed to be able to better predict and understand another's preferences and behaviour.

"Enterprise" loves MBTI because of how it puts people into neatly labelled boxes. Consultants love MBTI because enterprise loves MBTI. Which is why I was sitting in said course.

# I got `INTP`.
* `I` **I**ntroverted
* `N` I**n**tuitive
* `T` **T**hinking
* `P` **P**erceiving

# 25% science.
The first part can turn out to be either **i**ntrovert of **e**xtrovert. In our group, this scale seemed to yield the clearest results. Given that most attendees were software developers, it should come as no surprise that most of us ended up getting *I*.

Why? There's a large body of research and a variety of literature on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Software development is consistently described as a field that attracts introverts. So I'm going to let this one pass as it's both scientificallly grounded and relevant in day-to-day life.

I won't reiterate what is already well-described in aforementioned books. But just to give one example, it's why many of us prefer the asynchronous nature of electronic means of communication (i.e. email, chat) over synchronous face-to-face "talk".

# 75% percent bullshit.
My beef with the other three is not that they don't apply to me. Quite the opposite actually. It's because they are worded so vaguely that they apply to *everybody* and are inherently context dependant. Testing for them only captures one's preference *at the time of the test*, under the conditions of the test. But under different circumstances I might as well come out as the polar opposite.

The results are ambiguous, scientifically dubious and have no practical relevante in day-to-day life.

Our "trainer" argued that MBTI merelly describes a *preference*, not a general rule. This is already huge red flag. I would tend to agree if people didn't naturally end up using the scores to reduce a person to their scores. Even the "trainer" commenced describing how *I's* do this and *E's* do that.

The group happily followed her example. Some wrote their scores on their name signs, clearly identifying with it.

# Pseudo-science is pseudo.
In my opinion, the MBTI profiles of the sixteen MBTI types read very much like zoiac signs in astrology. Meaning they are written in such a way that they could apply to anyone. If you're told you're X, you'll go "Wow, that's *so* like me! I'm such a typical X!".

So while the fine print states MBTI is just a preference, the scores quickly become comfortable boxes. Once you're convinced that you are an *XXXX*, you identify with it so much that you become it. When a situation arises that seems to fit the profile, it's "wow, that's obviously because I'm X!". When the profile is at odds with behaviour, it's ignored.

The bias is strong with MBTI.

I buy into the introvert-extrovert spectrum, but the rest is too dynamic for anyone to have a meaningful score. Companies like Myers-Briggs because it puts people into convenient little boxes.

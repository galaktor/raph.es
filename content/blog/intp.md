I am an *introvert*.

I know this because I took a test. It was part of a three day course for work. We all did a short *Myers-Briggs* test and got four numbers in the end. Each number then tells you where you sit on four linear scales. Each scale is split through the middle and - depending on which half your number falls on - you get one of two letters per scale.

The resulting four letters combine to form your *Myers-Briggs Type Indicator* (MBTI). By knowing someone's MBTI, you're supposed to be able to better predict and understand another's preferences and behaviour.

"Enterprise" loves MBTI because of how it puts people into neatly labelled boxes. Consultants love MBTI because enterprise loves MBTI. Which is why I was sitting in said course.

# I got `INTP`.
* `I`: **i**ntroverted
* `N`: i**n**tuitive
* `T`: **t**hinking
* `P`: **p**erceiving

# 25% science.
The first part can turn out to be either **i**ntrovert of **e**xtrovert. In our group, this scale seemed to yield the clearest results. Given that most attendees were software developers, it should come as no surprise that most of us ended up getting *I*.

Why? There's a large body of research and a variety of literature on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Software development is consistently described as a field that attracts introverts. So I'm going to let this one pass as it's both scientificallly grounded and relevant in day-to-day life.

I won't reiterate what is already well-described in aforementioned books. But just to give one example, it's why many of us prefer the asynchronous nature of electronic means of communication (i.e. email, chat) over synchronous face-to-face "talk".

# 75% percent bullshit.
My beef with the other three is not that they don't apply to me. Quite the opposite actually. It's because they are worded so vaguely that they apply to *everybody* and are inherently context dependant. Testing for them only captures one's preference *at the time of the test*, under the conditions of the test. But under different circumstances I might as well come out as the polar opposite.

The results are ambiguous, scientifically dubious and have no practical relevante in day-to-day life.

Our "trainer" argued that MBTI merelly describes a *preference*, not a general rule (red flag!). I might have agreed if people hadn't instantly fell into a pattern of reducing others to their scores. "*P's* do `x` while *J's* do `y`", the trainer would say.

Most of us wore their score like a badge. Literally: many wrote their scores in big letters onto the name signs in front of them. Gradually, people with similar scores formed little teams. In what superficially appeared to be innocent fun, teams made fun of the others' MBTI-stereotypes. "Haha, you *X* be so crazy."

# Pseudo-science is pseudo.
Reading through the profiles of the sixteen MBTI types reminded me strongly of [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology_and_science). The profiles are written in such a way that they could apply to anbody.


So while the fine print states MBTI is just a preference, the scores quickly become comfortable boxes. Once you're convinced that you are an *XXXX*, you identify with it so much that you become it. When a situation arises that seems to fit the profile, it's "wow, that's obviously because I'm X!". When the profile is at odds with behaviour, it's ignored.

See also: *confirmation bias*.

The bias is strong with MBTI.

# Why does this work?
Most people enjoy personality tests and are quick to identify with the results, because they confirm your secret expectations. Just look at how successful pseudo-scientific tests are in magazine's or social media (i.e. Facebook).

The ritual of completing the test first gives a sense of achievement, followed up by your hard-earned score. Littered with big sciency words, it passes most initial bullshit smell tests. Enough to slip through the mental guard most of us have built after years of living in a world full of people trying to take your money.



I buy into the introvert-extrovert spectrum, but the rest is too dynamic for anyone to have a meaningful score. Companies like Myers-Briggs because it puts people into convenient little boxes.

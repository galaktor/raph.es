I'm officially the owner of a mechanical keyboard! The 60% (= 61 key) *WASD VP3*, which is really just a *Vortex Pok3r* with ABS keycaps that you can customize in neat ways. I chose Cherry MX *Clears* because I wanted tactile, but not clicky since I'll be using this in the office and don't want to start a war.

# Pics!
Let me apologise in advance for the photo quality. I unboxed the thing in the office, and only had my vintage smartphone at hand. I then later took some others with the DSLR, but the lighting in those pics is terrible (lots of bleed on the brighter-coloured keys). So, there you go. I tried. I even had a filthy shoe there for scale (it's a thing they do on /r/mk), but the MacBook should do the job.

Without further ado, here it is:

# The good
I've only started using this thing, but am loving it already. Typing is so much fun. I also think the design came out pretty good, given that I had no clue what I was even doing.

# The not-so-good
The shipping was fine on WASD's end - but because UPS had to charge customs, I had to change the shipping address half-way through and things got...complicated. It arrived a few days later than was predicted, but overall it took about two weeks.

WASD customer service was excellent before, during and after the purchase. Just polite, efficient, responsive and nice. They had a technician test if adding an LED to the PCB would work (it did). They worked with UPS to get my address changed quickly.

One thing that kinda went wrong on their end was that they didn't print the white "skull* legend onto the red escape key. I pointed that out and they promptly sent a new one my way - it's inbound as I'm typing this.

So, two thumbs up for WASD, they did not dissapoint.

# The ugly
A few things that I already don't like about the pok3r:

* the USB cable is flimsy. Sometimes the cable gets nudged a little bit and the keyboard disconnects. Gonna have to get a proper cable, and maybe mod the mini-USB socket on the PCB. Not cool.
*

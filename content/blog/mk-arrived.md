I'm officially the owner of a mechanical keyboard!



# First things first: pics!
Let me apologise in advance for the photo quality. I unboxed the thing in the office, and only had my vintage smartphone at hand. I then later took some others with the DSLR, but the lighting in those pics is terrible (lots of bleed on the brighter-coloured keys). So, there you go. I tried. I even had a filthy shoe there for scale (it's a thing they do on /r/mk), but the MacBook should do the job.

Without further ado, here it is:

# Specs
 The 60% (= 61 key) *WASD VP3*, which is really just a *Vortex Pok3r* with ABS keycaps that you can customize in neat ways. I chose [Cherry MX Clears](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Clear) because I wanted tactile, but not clicky since I'll be using this in the office and don't want to start a war.

The WASD keycaps are UV-printed ABS, which are then sealed for more longevity. I've heard mixed things about them, so my expectations were low. I must say, they feel quite nice for someone who's new to mechanical keyboards. My standards might rise over time, but for now I'm pretty damn happy with both caps and switches.

# The good
I've only started using this thing, but am loving it already. Typing is so much fun. I also think the design came out pretty good, given that I had no clue what I was even doing.

# The not-so-good
The shipping was fine on WASD's end - but because UPS had to charge customs, I had to change the shipping address half-way through and things got...complicated. It arrived a few days later than was predicted, but overall it took about two weeks.

WASD customer service was excellent before, during and after the purchase. Just polite, efficient, responsive and nice. They had a technician test if adding an LED to the PCB would work (it did). They worked with UPS to get my address changed quickly.

One thing that kinda went wrong on their end was that they didn't print the white "skull* legend onto the red escape key. I pointed that out and they promptly sent a new one my way - it's inbound as I'm typing this.

So, two thumbs up for WASD, they did not disapoint.

# The ugly
Here's a nit-picky summary about what isn't so cool about the board, but also the entire experience of getting it:

## The process
* WASD documentation on what you can and cannot do with the design isn't very clear. It took a leap of faith to go for it, but thankfully it worked out fine. Could've gone the other way, though.
* Shipping is sucky, especially when your address changes during the process. WASD were very helpful here.
* Customs into my country added fourty bucks onto the alredy pricey shipping. Good think the bulk was covered with my cash reward, so it doesn't sting too much.
* WASD forgot the legend on the ESC key, but are replacing it without any fuss.

## The board itself
* The USB cable connection is flimsy. Sometimes the cable gets nudged a little bit and the keyboard disconnects. Gonna have to get a proper cable, and maybe mod the mini-USB socket on the PCB. Not cool. You'd think with a sturdy board like this, they'd make a sturdy connector...
* The spacebar LED colours aren't that easy to see when switching layers.

# What's next?
The board is awesome, now that it's here and I'm getting a new ESC cap. Typing is a bliss. This is what I feel like when typing even the most mundane things:

Unfortunately for my wallet, I've tasted blood and am already thinking about what to build and/or buy next. There's so many configurations, keycap designs and switches to try, I don't even know where to start! My roadmap at the moment is:

* program the pok3r better for more fluent working (Emacs on a Mac - quite the challenge)
* solder on backlight LEDs under the keys. Probably a combination of amber and green. I have to wait a while for the switches to get settled before I can take them off, though.
* somehow improve the flimsy USB cable and/or connector
* Thinking about getting another MK afterwards, maybe a split one, and probably one to assemble from a kit. Because geek.

This is becoming a hobby - a fun, geeky, *expensive* hobby.

At this point, a little shoutout to the awesome [/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards). A wealth of information and advice awaits there.

There's a common problem among software engineers. Whenever someone asks us for an estimation on how long task X is going to take, it happens. "Ah, not a big deal, half a day, max." Is what we initially want to say. It happens to most people I know, and it happens to me.

It seems like there's a little geek inside us that wants to impress our customers by making it look like we're wizards. Somebody is asking you to do something, and obviously it's a problem complex enough that an engineer has to do it, now.

And it's all because of [Montgomery Scott](http://www.startrek.com/database_article/scott), aka "Scotty" from the Original Star Trek ensemble. Whenever Kirk asks Scotty to fix something, it goes somewhere along these lines:

> **Kirk**: "Scotty, can you get the warp drive online in 2 hours?"

> **Scotty**: "Lol captain, that's impossible. Do you have any idea how complex and fragile a matter/anti-matter propulsion engine is?? We'll have to..."

> **Kirk**: "Scotty, it's crucial that we prevent the universe from imploding so I can get into this alien chick's pants."

> **Scotty**: "Meh, I'll see what I can do..."

Just ask yourself how you know what you think you know about... well, anything. But especially things you recall to have "known" all your life, i.e. things you learned as a child from family and teachers. When we're young, we absorb and accept "facts" like a sponge. But many aren't factual at all, we just copy them from our environment and foget about them. From a basic evolutionary point of view, this is useful behavior. But we can do better.

In what you could call my personal little renaissance I began to revisit subjects which I had taken for granted all my life, including (but not limited to) religion, diet and habits I had adopted by imitating my environment. Like that bread and oatmeal are supposed to be healthy, but watch out for them eggs! Or how you have to eat every little bit that was put onto your plate, even if you're not hungry. Or how cool people drink beer when they go out. Even when and how I tie my shoes (note to self: blog material right there).

This process is ongoing and far from over. I do some things different than most people around me, but I consider that to be a good thing. You should try it sometime ;-)

MOVE
For a while, I blogged fairly frequently, which for me means once or twice a month. I even had a few minutes in the sun when the odd post hit Hacker News. That all stopped the moment I discovered Twitter.

Twitter gave me a convenient tool to rant, dump my thoughts in bite-size chunks and perpetuate cool things I found on the interwebs. The simplicity of use compared to writing and re-writing a blog entry for days just kept me from blogging at all.

## So, why a new blog?
I am not enrirely happy with Twitter. For one, there's the limitation of 140 characters per Tweet - which I often find to be a useful limitation that forces me to get creative. But also the fact that Twitter owns their platform and therefor controls my content does not agree with my personal philosophy. With my own blog, I control it all, on my own domain.

I found a better solution in static website generation (via Hugo) and hosting by NeoCities. It solves problems I had with Blogger in the first place, namely: * tedious WYSIWYG editing * always-on requirement * Google's tentacles all over it * limited control over layout and design

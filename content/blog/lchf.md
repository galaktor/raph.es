For most of my life, most of my caloric intake was from dietary carbohydrates. Just like the good old food pyramid told my parents. And my parents told me.

I at like most people my age did. And I thought it was reasonable. Fibre from oatmeal and cereals for breakfast. Lots of milk for the bones. White bread with nutella because *yum*. Fizzy drinks. Orange juice for the immune system. Rice and noodles with most dishes. Burger King ftw. Beer on the weekends. Cookies for dessert.

# Carbs made me fat
The story is the same for most men my age.

I clearly remember being super fit while I was in the military, age 18. I literally ate *ten* white bread sandwiches dripping with Nutella for breakfast - and maintained my weight under 80 kg, which is decent for my size.

My body chemistry changed shortly after, but my habits didn't. Habits I had absorbed into my brain during most of my early life.

At the time, like most people to this day, *at least* sixty percent of my daily caloric intake consisted of carbohydrate. Then some moderate amount of protein. And very little fat. Because fat is bad, right? (Spoiler: no).

During my twenties my weight gradually went up to nearly 100 kilos. I genuinely remember the moment when it hit 100.

I tried a number of diets for varying periods of time. I usually dropped a few kilos, felt good about myself. Time to reward myself with cake!

I eventually returned to old habits. Then gained again.

Nothing you haven't heard before, I bet.

# Carbs made me sick
Not only was I wearing much wider clothes. A few hours after most meals I'd get drowsy. The same after drinking beer. People laughed at how I would sometimes doze off when we were out at night. Once even during a loud heavy metal concert (`Fear Factory`).

Something was wrong, but not wrong enough for anybody to notice. Raph was just a tired guy, they'd think. And I would, too.

Then a key moment got me worried. I was wandering around the house on a lazy weekend day. This was in my  early twenties. I felt so weak, I nearly blacked out. Literally, I was having that tunnel-vision thing and thought I'd drop to the ground any moment.

I ~~inhaled~~ ate a yoghurt. Then another. My body was craving sugar. A few minutes later, the weakness had passed. That's when I decided to go to the doctor - I worried I might have diabetes. People in my family had it, so I recognized the pattern.

Whatever it was, surely the doctor would find it, right? (Spoiler: no).

# The doctor didn't find it
Our family doctor was good. A nice guy, competent, had been looking after the family for years.

I went for a full check-up. Something I'd do every year, anyway. They took lots of blood, did the ECG - the full monty. I told the doctor about what had happened.

When the results came back, nothing stood out. I was fine, according to standard medicine.

The thing is, I *wasn't.*

I almost forgot to mention, at the time I would regularly get serious migraine attacks. The kind where you darken the room, wrap yourself in a blanket and hope you don't die until it stops the next day. My doctor's solution was really strong painkillers...

# Atkins fixed my mom
Without going into too much detail, my mother had been suffering from allergies and joint problems for many years. All doctors could ever do was give her injectios. Some directlly into the bone. Even the spine.

Nothing helped.

Like most people when they get a bit desperate, she turned to alternatives. Somewhere she had heard that cutting out grains and carbs had helped other people.

She bought a book and got started on the Atkins diet.

I smiled. Clearly, cutting carbs was a stupid thing to do. We supported her, but kept taking innocent stabs at how was missing out on all them great noodles and pizzas.

Her joint problems dissapeared after a few weeks. I mean, they were *gone*. Her doctor couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe it. Her allergies were better, too.

Not only that, she had lost lots of weight. And was feeling better than ever.

# Then I tried Atkins, too
When I did, I wanted to test it for a few weeks. That's how diets work, right? (Spoiler: no)

I got the little book off my mom, but never really read it - just the recipes. I enjoyed the bit where you got to eat some bacon. But *damn* did I miss the sweet stuff! I remember how much time I spent trying to find the right sweetener. Because obviously you need to replace all thsoe cakes and cookies somehow, right? And why don't they have low carb nutella?

From day one, I couldn't wait for the diet to end so I could have my precious carbs back. The cravings are insane, especially in the beginning.

Long story short: I dropped a bunch of kilos. But caved after a few weeks. Not overnight. It crept back into my habits. The creep starts with an exception (that *one* slice of cake). Then another. Then every Saturday. At this point, what difference does it make anyway?

It always starts with one little exception.

I had found out through experimentation with Atkins that cutting carbs did make me lose weight. My weight varied between 80 and 90 kilos. Still far from great. I went through a few phases like this. I was getting better at spotting carbs. They're everywhere. No way I can do this forever.

I should point out that I never really did the *actual* Atkins diet. Just followd some selected rules I found in the book - which itself wasn't *by* Atkins, just derived.

# For reals this time
At some point I finally got curious enough that I read about the underlying science of low carb diets. The most important books being by Atkins *proper* and Stephen Phinney.

I finally understood not only *what* to (not) eat, but also *why*. How the human body never evolved to be flooded with the hormone `insulin` all the time. How my body gradually changed it's reaction to insulin from *let's burn this stuff* to *let's hold onto this for a while*.

I learned that the condition I had been suffering was called `metabolic syndrome`, and is effectively an early stage of diabetes. Just not *diabetes-y* enough for standard medical tests to flag it. Which is why my doctor wasn't worried.

That drowsiness I always had? It was *hypoglycemia*.

Armed with knowledge, I decided to cut out carbs for good. From this point on, it wasn't just a way to drop a few kilos when I got desperate. It was the treatment for a medical condition that had me on a sure path to type 2 diabetes.

# LCHF
The above is a very simple summary of what was a year-long process of trial-and-error, doubt, self-experimentation and varying levels of success.

Fast forward to today.

Science has made lots of recent progress on the subject of what makes people fat. Yet most people hold onto what they learned in school. And what doctors tell them - just like I did when my doctor ignored my early diabetes symptoms.

After Atkins, Stephen Phinney and Jeff Volek have inpsired a new generation of low carb practitioners. Endurance athletes and olympians have even taken inspiration from their work, but also from the former carbo-loading runner Tim Noakes.

The lipid hypothesis - born in the USA, exported to most of the world and which makes eating fat responsible for obesity - has been shown to have no scientific foundation whatsoever. Quite the opposite, actually. A nauseating amount of accidental and deliberate misinterpretation of data, to a point where it's not unreasonable to call it a conspiracy.

The modern concensus on the low-carb front is: your body does not need *any* dietary carbohydrates. It can and will produce glycogen where required. Humans have evolved to eat mostly fat, some protein and every now and then a tiny little bit of sugar.

Sweden recommends to it's citizens a diet low in carb and high in fat (aka `LCHF`). Protein consumption remains moderate.

# And me?
I'm healthier and fitter than I've ever been *in my entire life*.

I track my macronutrient ratio for most days. It's about 70% fat, 25% or more protein, the rest are carbs (from dairy, veggies).

I go out of my way to avoid processed carbohydrates such as grains, flour, sugar, wheat. I gorge on fat in meat, cheese, eggs, cream, butter. But I also eat a large amount of salad and vegetables, mostly the green ones.

My weight is steady around 72 kg. I don't only feel excellent, but my medical results are, too. Blood cholesterol is perfect, in case you were wondering.

The drowsiness and black outs are history. Not only that, I'm basically never tired. Or even reallly hungry. I sleep when it makes sense to sleep, not when I am about to pass out. Same with food: Eating is a routine to keep my engine going. Not to say I don't enjoy my egg and bacon breakfasts. But I can go very long before even noticing that I haven't ate in hours.

Oh, and I haven't had migraine in years.

The following is an anecodote about how I changed my diet. And with it, my life.

# I got fat after my teens.
For most of my life, the majority of my caloric intake was from dietary carbohydrates. I made no secret of how much I loved pizza and pasta. Bugers and subs. Fairly reasonable, I thought. Certainly not uber healthy. But not too far off, either.

I clearly remember being quite slim while I was sixteen years old. For breakfast I would often eat literally *ten* slices of toast, each dripping with Nutella. I didn't check my weight often, but when I did, it was a good bit under 80 kg. Before I was twenty, my weight hit 90kg.

Now and then I'd go to the gym. I took up running. I tried a number of diets. These short periods of determination caused dents in my weight curve, but didn't stop the trend. I was getting fat, fast. I genuinely remember the moment when it hit 100 kg. Not a great milestone, to put it mildly.

Now, I wasn't extremely obese. But fat enough to feel very uncomfortable. Especially when I got dragged to the pool or beach and couldn't hide under wide clothes.

Nothing you haven't heard before, I bet.

# Carbs made me sick
Not only was I wearing much wider clothes. Within an hour after meals I'd get drowsy. You know that afternoon low at work, right? But also after drinking beer. It seemed to amuse others how I would sometimes doze off when we were out at night. Most notably during a loud heavy metal concert (`Fear Factory`). Raph is just not a night person, they'd think. So would I. Strangely, I wasn't a morning person, either. I was tired a lot.

Something was wrong, but not wrong enough for anybody to be concnerned. 

One lazy Sunday I was wandering around the house. This was in my early twenties. I suddenly felt so weak, I nearly blacked out. Literally, I was having that tunnel-vision thing. I thought I'd drop to the ground any moment.

More than usual, I *craved* something sweet. I ~~inhaled~~ ate a yoghurt, as if my life depended on it. Then another. A few minutes later, the weakness had passed.

People I know have diabetes, so I knew what *hypoglycemia* looked like. That's when I decided to go to the doctor. Whatever it was, surely the doctor would fix it, right? (Spoiler: no).

# The doctor said I'm fine
Our family doctor was a good guy. Competent, experienced. He'd been looking after the family for years.

I went for a full check-up. Something I did once a year, just in case. They took body fluids, made me exhale a lot, did the ECG - the full monty. I told the doctor about what had happened. When the results came back a few days later, nothing stood out. According to standard medicine, I was in great shape.

The thing is, I *wasn't.*

I almost forgot to mention, at the time I would also regularly get serious migraine attacks. The kind where you darken the room, wrap yourself in a blanket and hope you won't *die* until it stops (usually the next day). My doctor's solution to that was really strong painkillers.

# Atkins fixed my mom
Without going into too much detail, my mother had been suffering from various allergies and joint problems for many years. All doctors could ever do was give her injections. Some directlly into the bone. The spine.

Nothing helped. She suffered a lot. Like most people when they get a bit desperate, she seeked out alternatives. Acupuncture didn't work (no surprise there). Somewhere she had heard that cutting out grains and carbs had helped others like her.

She bought a random book and got started on the Atkins diet.

I smiled when she told me. Clearly, cutting carbs was a ridiculous thing to do. Your body needs carbs, right? At best, it sounded extreme. We supported her, but occasionally took humorous stabs at how she missed out on all them tasty noodles and pizzas.

Her joint problems dissapeared after a few weeks. They were *gone*. Her allergies were better, too. We couldn't believe it. The *doctor* couldn't believe it.

As a nice side effect, she had lost lots of weight. And was feeling better than ever.

# Atkins, half-assed
I was very sceptical, but saw how it helped my mom. Since I had tried virtually all other diets, I figured, what the heck.

When I did, I wanted to test it for a few weeks. That's how diets work, right? (Spoiler: no)

I should point out that I never really did the *actual* Atkins diet. Just followd some selected rules I found in the book - which itself wasn't *by* Atkins, just derived.

I got the little book off my mom, but never really read it - just the recipes. I enjoyed the bit where you got to eat some bacon. But *damn* did I miss the sweet stuff! Most of what I remember from the time was trying to find suitable replacements for cakes, cookies and other sugary things.

I couldn't wait for the diet to end so I could have my precious carbs back. In my mind, not eating carbs was a temporary treatment. It had an expiration date. Take three of these for four weeks. Then everything will be ok.

Long story short: I dropped a bunch of kilos. But caved after a few weeks. Not overnight. It crept back into my habits. The creep starts with an exception (that *one* slice of cake). Then another. Then every Saturday. At this point, what difference does it make anyway?

It always starts with one little exception. One moment of weakness.

# I came out smarter
I had found out through experimentation with Atkins ideas that cutting carbs did made me lose weight. My weight stabilized (more or less) between 80 and 90 kilos. Not great, but stable.

What made this way of losing weight easier than other diets I had tried? Identifying the stuff I shouldn't eat was much easier - at least the big offenders. Weight watchers concepts and other generic calorie-reduced diet allow you to eat anything, really. Bad stuff uses up all your points or calories or whatever it is they track. Had a double whopper for breakfast? Well, you'll have to get through the rest of the day on water and celery.

On paper, that's great. In practice, people cave after a few days, maybe weeks.





# For reals this time
At some point I finally got curious enough that I read about the underlying science of low carb diets. The most important books being by Atkins *proper* and Stephen Phinney.

I finally understood not only *what* to (not) eat, but also *why*. How the human body never evolved to be flooded with the hormone `insulin` all the time. How my body gradually changed it's reaction to insulin from *let's burn this stuff* to *let's hold onto this for a while*.

I learned that the condition I had been suffering was called `metabolic syndrome`, and is effectively an early stage of diabetes. Just not *diabetes-y* enough for standard medical tests to flag it. Which is why my doctor wasn't worried.

That drowsiness I always had? It was *hypoglycemia*.

Armed with knowledge, I decided to cut out carbs for good. From this point on, it wasn't just a way to drop a few kilos when I got desperate. It was the treatment for a medical condition that had me on a sure path to type 2 diabetes.

# What I didn't know
I now know what I wish someone had told me back then: My body chemistry changed after puberty, but my habits did not.

My diet wasn't so different from other people. At the time, at least sixty percent of my daily caloric intake consisted of carbohydrate. Then some moderate amount of protein, typically from lean meat. And very little fat - because fat is bad, right? (Spoiler: no). Most people in the western world consume a similar ratio of macronutritents.

When we're young and fresh, our bodies require crazy amounts of energy to grow. Not just in size. Also internally. Organs and the likes. In addition to that, I used to spend lots of time outside running around and playing soccer. At the time, my body was pretty good at metabolising all the carbohydrate I was taking in.

After the hormonal shitstorm which is puberty, my body's response to carbhohydrate changed forever.

Without exception, dietary carbohydrate effectively turns into sugar. Don't believe me? Take a bite of the brownest bread you can find. Leave it in your mouth for a few minutes. It will turn sweet. This is your body breaking it down into sugar.

In order to make sugar into energy, our brain tells our pancreas to release insuline. Insuline is a hormone. In theory, it will cause your muscles to take up the energy from the sugar. You'll feel energized. Watch little kids a few minutes after they've had sweets. They'll jump around, shout, be annoying. It's they're body trying to burn off all that new energy.

Unfortunately for most people, this doesn't work forever. Hormones aren't straight-forward and interact in complicated ways. After puberty and years of flooding my cells with insulin, my body got worse at metabolising it. Instead, the insulin causes the energy to be stored as fat.

This is by design. Insulin does this. It makes cells store fat for later. An effective survival strategy.

# LCHF
The above is a very simple summary of what was a year-long process of trial-and-error, doubt, self-experimentation and varying levels of success.

Fast forward to today.

Science has made lots of recent progress on the subject of what makes people fat. Yet most people hold onto what they learned in school. And what doctors tell them - just like I did when my doctor ignored my early diabetes symptoms.

After Atkins, Stephen Phinney and Jeff Volek have inpsired a new generation of low carb practitioners. Endurance athletes and olympians have even taken inspiration from their work, but also from the former carbo-loading runner Tim Noakes.

The lipid hypothesis - born in the USA, exported to most of the world and which makes eating fat responsible for obesity - has been shown to have no scientific foundation whatsoever. Quite the opposite, actually. A nauseating amount of accidental and deliberate misinterpretation of data, to a point where it's not unreasonable to call it a conspiracy.

The modern concensus on the low-carb front is: your body does not need *any* dietary carbohydrates. It can and will produce glycogen where required. Humans have evolved to eat mostly fat, some protein and every now and then a tiny little bit of sugar.

Sweden recommends to it's citizens a diet low in carb and high in fat (aka `LCHF`). Protein consumption remains moderate.

# And me?
I'm healthier and fitter than I've ever been *in my entire life*.

I track my macronutrient ratio for most days. It's about 70% fat, 25% or more protein, the rest are carbs (from dairy, veggies).

I go out of my way to avoid processed carbohydrates such as grains, flour, sugar, wheat. I gorge on fat in meat, cheese, eggs, cream, butter. But I also eat a large amount of salad and vegetables, mostly the green ones.

My weight is steady around 72 kg. I don't only feel excellent, but my medical results are, too. Blood cholesterol is perfect, in case you were wondering.

The drowsiness and black outs are history. Not only that, I'm basically never tired. Or even reallly hungry. I sleep when it makes sense to sleep, not when I am about to pass out. Same with food: Eating is a routine to keep my engine going. Not to say I don't enjoy my egg and bacon breakfasts. But I can go very long before even noticing that I haven't ate in hours.

Oh, and I haven't had migraine in years.

Xylitol is the best sweetener ever.

Xylitol can partially be metabolised as carbohydrate.

It can spike your insulin.

When sweet is needed, deserts etc, it's a godsend.

Xylitol gum is the devil.

It combines a well-trained cue/reward loop (fresh mint = clean teeth) with an insulin spike.

Together makes the sneakiest fucking bad habit I've had in ages.

Going cold turkey on gum for now. And for a while, on any sweeteners, too.

The boxes make a nice little water-proof project box, though!

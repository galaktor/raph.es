I often behave like a I am still just a kid, only with more than five bucks allowance. As such, I somtimes spend unreasonable money on gimmicks and gadgets based solely on the awesome things I *imagine* I can use them for.

TODO PIC KID IN CANDY SHOP

Reality catches up eventually, and in one such case I found myself with several spare Raspberry Pi computers in my Command Centre (aka "where we hang the clothes to dry").

TODO PIC PIS

I figured I could spare one for the kids. To justify my spending but also because the Pi was designed to educate children. And if first-world kids lack education in any subject, then that's *Old Video Games Nobody Plays Anymore*. Obviously.

Born in the early eighties, I am among the first generation of kids to grow up with video games being just a normal thing. Anyone before us met electronic games as a newfangled imitation of other forms of entertainment.

PIC AWESOME GRAPHICS GAME

Kids today grow up with flashy graphics and epic soindtracks. Technically, they are amazing. But gameplay is not always on par. Older games had to work with many more constraints. And constraints fosters creativity in important ways.

TODO PIC CASTLE CRASHERS

Thus, finding good modern games for kids is not as easy as you might expect. Most of the plethora of mobile games are full of ads, in-app purchases or are designed around a single mind-numbing yet addictive mechanic for more generic appeal. Or all of the above.

TODO PIC MINECRAFT

Console games for kids are not much better. Most are either badly executed, too difficult or simply not appropriate for smaller kids. Many of the best console games seem innocent enough but have simple violent mechanics at their core. One kid is still traumatized from that time we tried out the demo of *Castle Crashers*. Granted, I could have noticed the PEGI 18, but for fuck's sake.

TODO PIC CASTLE CRASHERS

Anyhow, we have a retro console using a Pi, and I will tell you how we did it. In a later post. See you there!

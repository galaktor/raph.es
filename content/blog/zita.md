# tl;dr
Your children *need* Zita The Spacegirl.

# Heroes, heroes, everywhere

A steady stream of superhero flicks keeps tearing up the box office and whatever is left of television programmes, with no [end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Future) in [sight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics%27_shared_universe_films#Future). For kids trapped inside adult bodies like me, this is the best time to be alive.

Nerdstalgia aside, I'm also a parent. And as such I am very critical of the media I expose my children to. Lot of junk is being thrown at kids. I will try not to get stuck in a rant about the rampant sexism and capitalist brainwashing present in so-called children's entertainment - that's for another post. Suffice to say for now that I have an aggressive bullshit filter for things I let through to my children's sensitive brains.

# Fear not!

Not all is lost. Some people are making really good, progressive comics, very suitable for children. I'd like to highlight one such gem right now.

*[Zita The Spacegirl](http://zitaspacegirl.com)* began as a [web comic](http://zitaspacegirl.com/webcomics) by [Ben Hatke](http://www.benhatke.com). Hatke later set out to tell Zita's origin story in the form of a [graphic novel](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8879121-zita-the-spacegirl) trilogy.

Zita's adventure begins with her best friend Joseph being kidnapped by a creepy alien thing - and it's *Zita's* fault. That's some serious drama right off the bat. Just because it's a story for children, doesn't mean it has to be fluffy kittens, right?

The events spanning the books have it all: action, spaceships, giant mice,  high stakes and sacrifice. But is never gruesome or overly violent. It's never as predictable as most books in the children's section would be.

The illustrations are excellent. Hatke knows how to do composition and lighting to great effect. Even though space is usually a dark place, the story is mostly bright and colourful. The occasional dark moments remain light-hearted enough to keep nightmares at bay.

I personally love the slightly rough art style. Why hide the fact that this was drawn by hand? Making kids realize that these things are made by people with a pen and some paper shows them that with soem practice, they could do something like it, too. The sketches included at the end of each book show how much fun and love Hatke put into the works, for adults and kids to appreciate.

# More than just art
Besides being easy on the eyes, the plot is what really makes Zita special. Hatke avoids most of the overused tropes known from mainstream comics. He handles difficult topics like responsibility, tolerance, sacrifice or slavery in sensitive, tasteful ways. The story never gets to complicated and doesn't need much explaining for kids to follow along.

The characters are loveable and relatable. Also very interesting are all the tiny details scattered throughout the books, giving a charming sense of authenticity to the world and it's many inhabitants. Some characters show up in just a few panels, yet still manage to be memorable.

# Just a quick rant
One of my favorite things about the Zita books is that none of the charactes are overly sexualized.

Zita herself is a young girl, so there's something really *wrong* about having to point this out at all. Girls grow up seeing sexed-up females virtually everywhere, and sadly toys and media for children are no exception. Comics are merely one of the more obvious cases where female as well as male bodies are exaggerated beyond belief, creating unrealistic role models for girls and boys alike.

Exhibit B: Maldrigal, the second female protagonist, is an adult. A lesser artist might have created her as a one-dimensional love interest of Piper and left it at that. Hatke, however, does better. What we get resembles more a Zoe from Firefly than Xena.

REVIEW THIS
Exhibit B: *Madrigal*, a central supporting character, is an mixed-race, mysterious, tough and strong-minded woman who - in the hands of a lesser artist - would have easily been cast into the hyper-sexual amazonian exotic pornstar mold that is so often used.

TODO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN XENA

On the race-and-gender scale (tm), the books tip a bit heavy on the male/caucasian side, but overall it's rather balanced out. Just consider all the aliens of undefined race or gender. In general, the big plus is that females are independant, powerful and not just defined by their relationship to males in the story. The stuff decent role models are made of.

Heck, Zita sets out to save her male friend, and not the other way around. And did I mention that it's her fault, too? I find that highly unusual, in a good way.

Love and friendship are at the heart of the story.

Good role model for girls. See also: cosplay.

Presents a decent female character to boys. Also, male protagonists are not overblown muscle monsters (except for maybe strong-strong).

Outtakes and making-of snippets at the end of each book.

Concludes as a trilogy, making it easy to get all books and have a round story as opposed to Marvel or DC where you would need to read four million comics with zero continuity to catch up.

Part of me would really love to see this made into a film. Then again, it feels like Zita is just perfect as a graphic novel.

It would however make for an excellent video game. I might give the idea a shot with the kids, seems like an achievable way to learn some game design chops.

Support less-mainstream comic artists and publishers.

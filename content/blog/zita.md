*[Zita The Spacegirl](http://zitaspacegirl.com)* began as a [web comic](http://zitaspacegirl.com/webcomics) by [Ben Hatke](http://www.benhatke.com), which he later turned it into a [graphic novel](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8879121-zita-the-spacegirl) trilogy telling her origin story. The books happen to be favorites in our house.

TL;DR if you have children, you need to buy the Zita trilogy.

Great art and visual storytelling. Not sterile, clearly hand-made and organic. Inspires kids to draw.

TODO PIC STORYTELLING

Defies typical comic tropes.

Zita is not sexualized (neither is anyone else). Genders rather balanced out (gender for most monsters is hard to identify). Females are powerful and not defined by their relationship to males in the story.

Features action, high stakes and sacrifice, but is not over-the-top gruesome or violent. Has some dramatic twists and is entertaining for all ages.

Love and friendship are at the heart of the story.

Good role model for girls. See also: cosplay.

Presents a decent female character to boys. Also, male protagonists are not overblown muscle monsters (except for maybe strong-strong).

Outtakes and making-of snippets at the end of each book.

Concludes as a trilogy, making it easy to get all books and have a round story as opposed to Marvel or DC where you would need to read four million comics with zero continuity to catch up.

Part of me would really love to see this made into a film. Then again, it feels like Zita is just perfect as a graphic novel.

It would however make for an excellent video game. I might give the idea a shot with the kids, seems like an achievable way to learn some game design chops.

# tl;dr
Your children *need* Zita The Spacegirl.

# Heroes, heroes, everywhere

A steady stream of superhero flicks keeps tearing up the box office and whatever is left of television programmes, with no [end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Future) in [sight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics%27_shared_universe_films#Future). For kids trapped inside adult bodies like me, this is the best time to be alive.

Nerdstalgia aside, I'm also a parent. And as such I am very critical of the media I expose my children to. There's a lot of junk out there targetted at children. I will try not to get caught up in the details of rampant sexism and capitalist brainwashing present in so-called chilren's entertainment - although I probably will expand on that in later posts. Suffice to say for now that I have an aggressive bullshit filter for things I let through to my children's sensitive brains.

# Fear not!

Not all is lost. Some people are making really good, progressive comics, very suitable for children. I'd like to highlight one such gem right now.

*[Zita The Spacegirl](http://zitaspacegirl.com)* began as a [web comic](http://zitaspacegirl.com/webcomics) by [Ben Hatke](http://www.benhatke.com), which he later turned into a [graphic novel](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8879121-zita-the-spacegirl) origin story trilogy.

Zita's adventure begins with her best friend Joseph falling into a wormhole of some sort - and it's *Zita's* fault. That's some serious drama right off the bat. Just because it's a story for children, doesn't mean it has to be fluffy kittens, right?

The plot that develops over the next three books has action, high stakes and sacrifice, but is not over-the-top gruesome or violent. It's fresh and not at all as predictable as most books in the children's section would be. Hatke's excellent organic hand-drawn style, lighting and colouring keep even the darkest moments light enough to avoid trauma.

Besides having cool visuals, the plot is what really stands out. It avoids most of the stereotypical tropes of mainstream comics. Hatke handles difficult topics like responsibility, tolerance, sacrifice or slavery in a sensitive, tasteful way.

The main protagonists have complex relationships, for instance Zita and her friend Joseph, who gets kidnapped by aliens because Zita was having a reckless moment - something children do all the time.

But maybe even more interesting are all the details Hatke has given the world and it's many inhabitants. Some memorable characters show up for just a few panels or pages.

PIC EXAMPLE MEMORABLE LITTLE CHARACTER

One of my favorite things about Zita is that none of the characters are overly sexualized.

Zita herself

Maldrigal

Males, too

Two males, two females, diversity, respect.

This might seem like a strange thing to point out, especially since she's a *young girl*. But if you've looked at any female character in the big franchises - even young ones - you'll notice a disturbing tendency among artists to exagerate their female anatomies far beyond comfortable territory.

If you don't notice it, then I'll go out on a limb here and assume that you probably don't have daughters.

Hatke, refreshingly, successfully avoids this type of sexualisation, and not just with Zita herself.

Exhibit B: *Madrigal*, a central supporting character, is an mixed-race, mysterious, tough and strong-minded woman who - in the hands of a lesser artist - would have easily been cast into the hyper-sexual amazonian exotic pornstar mold that is so often used.

On the race-and-gender scale (tm), the books tip a bit heavy on the male/caucasian side, but overall it's rather balanced out. Just consider all the aliens of undefined race or gender. In general, the big plus is that females are independant, powerful and not just defined by their relationship to males in the story. The stuff decent role models are made of.

Heck, Zita sets out to save her male friend, and not the other way around. And did I mention that it's her fault, too? I find that highly unusual, in a good way.

Love and friendship are at the heart of the story.

TODO PIC web comic about love
http://zitaspacegirl.com/webcomics-2/

Good role model for girls. See also: cosplay.

Presents a decent female character to boys. Also, male protagonists are not overblown muscle monsters (except for maybe strong-strong).

Outtakes and making-of snippets at the end of each book.

Concludes as a trilogy, making it easy to get all books and have a round story as opposed to Marvel or DC where you would need to read four million comics with zero continuity to catch up.

Part of me would really love to see this made into a film. Then again, it feels like Zita is just perfect as a graphic novel.

It would however make for an excellent video game. I might give the idea a shot with the kids, seems like an achievable way to learn some game design chops.

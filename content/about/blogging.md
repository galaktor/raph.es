I'm not known to be an early adopter. I was late to the party for blogs with my [first](/blog/2011/02/just-do-it/) attempt ocurrring in 2011.

Of course I had toyed around with websites several times over the years. Most had a "news" section or similar. That's what people called their blogs before they were called blogs. The websites went the way of too many briefly interesting side-projects, and died of neglect.

Then web-two-point-oh gave us a plethora of free (beer) blog-as-a-service services. Public diaries with fancy client-side WYSIWYG editors.

I resisted the hype.

Until that urge to have a personal, public platform came around again. That was when I caved and signed up with Blogger.

# Invisible critics
At first I just welcomed the new public-ish outlet for rants. Ranting is easy.

But I also felt the urge to contribute some value to the world by sharing things I know or learn. Not that I expected many people to actually read it. However, the act of writing itself forced me to structure my thoughts. To have a beginning, a middle and an end. Which turned out to be the best *and worst* part of blogging.

Traffic trickled in well enough by my standards. Some of my old posts still get a good stream of visits. Mostly from web searches about problems I wrote about. A handful even hit the Hacker News front page and brought tens-of-thousands of eyeballs.

I put an unreasonable amount of pressure on myself to deliver value to my imaginary audience. Not only would a post have to contain a nugget of knowledge, but also live up to standards established by the popular technology blogs we all know and love - witty, to the point, well researched, properly spelled, not offensive but controversial enough to be interesting...

Add to that the apparent need to maintain a [defensive](http://pchiusano.github.io/2014-10-11/defensive-writing) stance at all times. Hedge any claims to always have an exit in case some wise guy publicly points out all the flaws in my article.

Blogging morphed from a tool for self-reflection into a stressful chore. Given that I have lots of stuff going on, it was frustrating to spend the little time I had with something I was enjoying less and less.

# Blogger is not for me.
Having this virtual spotlight pointed at me (imaginary or not) fed my natural urge to personalize the look and feel of my blog. Once I stepped outside the boundaries which are *themes* I realised that Blogger is not a platform for geeks like I am.

The widgets to insert functionality such as Twitter feeds looked terrible and didn't behave the way I wanted.

The HTML and CSS I found was a mess. Some failed attempts to hand craft my own theme - it was more tedious than I was willing to tolerate in my *me time*.

Most canned themes looked nothing like what I wanted *my* page to look like. Dynamic layouts [seemed](/blog/2012/05/The-blog-gets-some-love/) neat for five minutes. Then I noticed that every Blogger blog out there looked just like mine.

So I had a blog that wasn't fun to write for. That didn't look like *me*. That didn't do what I wanted it to do.

# Then Twitter happened.
I was late to the Twitter party, too. Just like I had once predicted in my first Blogger [post](/blog/2011/02/just-do-it/).

I reluctantly registered my account as I attended the [*Norwegian Developers Conference*](http://www.ndcoslo.com/) in 2012. NDC updates such as changes in schedule were distributed via Twitter. The way geek attendees interacted via large screens displaying live tweets hashtagged to the conference intrigued me.

"This is *social* media", I realised.

# Random five minutes
Tweets became my outlet for what would usually become once-a-month blog posts.

The 140 character limit took away the pressure to spend lots of time on what I publish. Yet, the subtle art of working with this limitation represented a playful challenge. The playing field was level. Nobody could make me feel bad for just throwing out a line or two - everyone did that.

The key moment was when I got an Android phone. It's Twitter app was responsive, and - more importantly - convenient. A quick and easy way to rant or share cool stuff. It filled those random, under-utilized five minutes spread out over any given day.

Expressing myself via Twitter felt much more natural than what I had found myself doing on Blogger.

# I stopped blogging overnight.
I have been using Twitter more and more ever since. My twitter profile became my new blog, just smaller. Unintentionally, I followed the trend from blogs to *microblogs*.

Why try to be a full-blown author on your blog when you can just fire out one-liners on Twitter? One was much more compatible with a first-worlders daily routine than the other - I was no exception.

# Taking back ownership


Less pressure, shorter blog -> more fun!
Blog is just a log on the web. Log depends on who I am. And I am not someone who can always spend hours/days on a post.




Want to get away from Twitter for most of what I post. Interact with other users, ok, but not use as some kind of virtual online persona. That's what this page is supposed to be. It's me on the web. Social networks just to reference this.

I am also late to the hardware party. It began with Arduino and I'm headed down the rabbit hole at a scary pace. You can find out more about my current hard and software projects [here](/project).







The urge that had led me to Blogger, Twitter couldn't really scratch either. It was simpler. But a lot less personal. And limited in how I could present myself.

Also, my awareness of pricacy issues went through some transformations over the past two years. Snowden happened. I became more involved with open technologies. Moved to linux.

Having my online *home* on a canned corporate profile didn't agree with my personality.

I am not enrirely happy with Twitter. For one, there's the limitation of 140 characters per Tweet - which I often find to be a useful limitation that forces me to get creative. But also the fact that Twitter owns their platform and therefor controls my content does not agree with my personal philosophy. With my own blog, I control it all, on my own domain.

I found a better solution in static website generation (via Hugo) and hosting by NeoCities. It solves problems I had with Blogger in the first place, namely: * tedious WYSIWYG editing * always-on requirement * Google's tentacles all over it * limited control over layout and design

I have a cheap set of goggles I wear when I do soldering and other eye-threatening activities. Since most of the time I work in the evenings after the little people went to bed, I though it would be neat if it had a little LED attached to illuminate my view.

This was a quick and dirty hack where I salvaged LED and lense from an IKEA USB lamp. Then simply screwed it to my goggles. Check out the [blog](/blog/2014/10/headlamp/) for details.

I have a cheap set of goggles I wear when I do soldering and other eye-threatening activities. Since most of the time I work in the evenings after the little people went to bed, I though it would be neat if it had a little LED attached to illuminate my view.

While I decided to stick it to the goggles, you certainly could mount this light to anything else (tools, masks, gloves). I deliberately mounted the light so that I can take it off again without damaging the light or the goggles. Because you never know when you can use a little light!

This was a quick and dirty hack where I salvaged bright LED with lense from an IKEA USB lamp. Then simply screwed it to my goggles. The whole thing took about an hour.

My first stab at a custom-designed keyboard. It's for a [61-key VP3 from WASD](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-vp3-61-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html).

# Source code
The keyboard is in production with WASD - I won't know if this design is any good until the result comes back. You were warned.

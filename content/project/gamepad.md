I bought a crappy SNES gamepad rip-off from Ebay for like two dollars. I gutted the thing and am replacing the insides with an Arduino, some retro switches and lights. A USB-chargable LiPo will provide power and I'll write a custom protocol to send/receive button presses to our Retro-Pie game console.

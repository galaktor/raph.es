I thought it would be neat to build a (nearly) disposable video cam to wear on mudruns - where stuff gets wet, dirty, broken and lost.

My progress so far stopped as I was figuring out the power questions when using a Raspberry Pi (v1) on a battery. The newer RPi versions look much better for crunching video but they fare probably a lot worse power-wise. If I pick this up again, I'll probably stick with the Model A I began with.

# Materials
* Raspberry Pi Model A + Camera module
* MCP 1826S 3.3V voltage regulator
* IP-66 waterproof junction box
* Waterproof cable glands
* Airsoft replica MICH helmet with rails
* ~30cm HDMI cable
* 2 CSI breakout connectors to hook up HDMI cables to Pi
* Waterproof momentary switch with LED ring
* 2000mAh - 3000m+Ah single-cell 3.7C LiPo battery (e.g. for tablets)

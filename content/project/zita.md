Inspired by videos of cosplayers online, my daughter set out to make a Zita costume. Zita is rather on the simple side as cosplay goes, making it ideal as a first project of this kind. And if the pictures of Zita costumes on Hatke's blog [are](http://www.benhatke.com/2014/10/a-halloween-post-with-trick-and-treat.html) [any](http://www.benhatke.com/2013/11/the-great-zita-spacegirl-costume-parade_5.html) [indication](http://www.benhatke.com/2013/11/the-great-zita-spacegirl-costume-parade.html), we aren't the first fans to work on a costume, either.

It took only a few hours from finding the right materials to stitching everything together. I encouraged her to document the process and write up a little recap.

[RetroPie](http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie) is an emulator suite for the Raspberry Pi. This project was not very difficult, but requited a bit of custumization.

The Pi is enclosed in a lego case I built with the kids. We use our wireless Xbox 360 controllers for input. And the kids made a custom splash screen, too!

Now I can replay all my childhood Nintendo and Sega classics. With my *own* kids, which just blows my mind. Full circle.

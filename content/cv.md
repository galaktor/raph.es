# Raphael Estrada
I'm a versatile Software Engineer, team leader and mentor. In over a decade I have successfully developed and deployed a large [variety](#projects) of software products. [Most recently](#algo) low-latency algorithmic trading systems built on the .NET stack. In my spare time I make *Stuff*, often involving Linux, electronics and embedded software.

## Robots not allowed
If you happen to be a recruitment robot looking to match keywords against an obscure job profile then I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment. This CV might not compute.

I've been on both ends of the interview process and frankly, I'm not a fan tuning CVs to game recruitment algorithms. Instead, I offer an honest human-readable account of my experience and work ethics.

So in the case that you are a human who is genuinely looking for a talented, passionate and creative addition to their engineering team, please take a few minutes to read on.

### Note
This is a public web site. To protect the innocent, I've omitted some details below. More information, references and a 'traditional' style CV are available upon request.

# Methodology and ethics
Like other engineers, I love to make stuff. Not many things are as exhilarating as creating something from scratch and releasing it into the wild. When it comes to achieving that, however, opinions among engineers can vary quite a lot.

To give you an impression of how I approach the challenges of engineering, allow me to share some of the opinions I have formed over the years. This could help you gauge how well I might fit into your team and culture.

## Tools of the trade
This is where people typically list every programming language they have ever used for more than five minutes. I'll deliberately spare you the pointless name dropping. You can find some tools I've used further down where I describe some [projects](#projects) I worked on.

Computers are dumb. It's not hard to tell them what to do. I've done so using many different languages. Strongly typed and dynamic. Compiled and interpreted. Object-oriented, functional and procedural. Various combinations of those.

I prefer UNIX-like operating systems - specifically GNU/Linux - but any will do. I'm comfortable with any IDE, am pretty fluent in Visual Studio. When given the choice, I would fall into the Emacs camp. 

I've been around long enough to know that having to learn new tools has just as little impact on my productivity as, say, my typing speed (which happens to be pretty decent, by the way). Of course, tools matter. Using the right (or wrong) one  can make all the difference in the world. But *learning* them is rarely the problem.

If I have to, I'll learn how to write [lolcode](http://lolcode.org/) in DVORAK in no time.

Much more than the programming language, it's other, less obvious things at your shop that will take time to get used to. The custom in-house software stack. Out-of-date documentation. The development process and risk procedures.

Those also happen to be things *nobody* brings along when they come in the door.

{{% anc design %}}
## Form follows function
Although my university [degree](#academia) was specialized in Computer Science, another significant portion of the course was [Communication Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_design). What I learned there strongly influences my perspective on *interfaces*. Not just GUIs but interfaces in general, and the kinds humans interact with in particular.

Interfaces come in many forms. In source code formatting and REST APIs. The names of unit tests and the wording of a user story. UML diagrams and the structure of project's files. The log files used to debug a crash. 

The end consumer is not the only user of a system. Priorities will vary, but a bit of design can help improve every users' experience as they interact with a product. And as a result improve the product itself.

That being said, I do have an artistic side that rears it's head occasionally. I love to draw. And when sufficiently inspired, I've been known to create icons, logos, artwork or mouse mats for projects I was involved on.

## Walking the Walk
In the software industry my peers tend to be smart people. They won't follow someone who cannot back their Talk with the equivalent amount of Walk. I'm no exception.

I don't like to call myself a "leader". But I have a habit of slipping into leadership roles in the teams I am part of. Not because I try to, but because I don't mind making decisions and taking on responsibility when required. Because I set a high bar for myself and others.

With me, I have been told, code reviews and retrospectives can be hard work. Honest reflection is difficult. Growth hurts. But I encourage others to be honest with me the same way. I *expect* them to. I tend to say, conflict is healthy. If it's easy, you're doing it wrong.

I don't explicitly try to lead by example. But by setting an example, I often end up leading.

{{% anc pragma %}}
## Pragmatic
My attitude towards *industry patterns and practices* has evolved in an interesting way. It used to be that I would cling firmly to the usual literature and enthusiastically spread the word.

With experience, however, I have become much more relaxed. Because I learned that those recipes were extracted from specific circumstances and don't always apply to the situation at hand. The reasoning often being "What if someone in the future wants to..."

There is but a thin line between *best practice* and *premature optimization*.

It's easy to read a book and learn when you can apply a tool. But only with experience - and by making mistakes first-hand - can you learn when *not* to.

{{% anc agile %}}
## Beyond agile
I'm a proudly **un**certified Scrum Master. *Proud* because after agile methodologies became cool a few years ago, Scrum has become a big business. Sold by consultants to enterprise. Implemented as rigid process beneath a blanket of scrum master certificates.

Scrum is a just another box of tools which *can* enable teams to work well. When done right, it looks different every time. It *must*, because people are different. Agile by definition cannot be a uniform process. Unfortunately, "it depends" isn't an easy answer, hence doesn't sell very well.

In my mind, being agile means to focus on what matters and to facilitate communication. Also known as: common sense. How this looks in practice is highly dependent on who you are and what you do.

Agility can only be certified by a working team.

## Free as in freedom
This is going to sound a bit cheesy, but I'm a strong believer in free software and that it makes the world a better place. If you've had a look around my blog, this won't come as much of a surprise. My personal projects - including this CV - are [licensed](/license) accordingly.

I also understand that many projects and businesses cannot and do not work like that. That's fine (and a little bit sad). I encourage my peers to contribute back to FOSS projects they find valuable. And I prefer employers who do so, too.

But to be absolutely clear: I *won't* just go and upload your proprietary code base to GitHub. However, I would certainly be delighted if you asked me to.

## Compatibility
Like many engineers, I'm an introvert. This doesn't mean I'm not a team player. I've a good track record of working well in teams of different sizes and a variety of nationalities. I'm comfortable interacting with other teams, management and customers. I've been told I'm even quite good at it.

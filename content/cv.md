I'm a versatile software engineer, team leader and mentor. In more than a decade I have successfully developed and delivered a large variety of software products.

## Warning: Robots not allowed
I've been on both ends of the interview process and frankly, I'm not a fan of what mainstream tech recruitment has become. Particularly, CVs which are tuned to game recruitment algorithms.

If you happen to be a recruitment robot looking to match keywords against some obscure job profile which you cannot comprehend then I'm afraid you're in for a disapointment. This CV might not compute.

If, however, you happen to be a human who is genuinely looking for a talented, passionate and creative addition to their engineering team then *please read on*.

# Highlights
## Programming
We both know you can't wait for this part, so let's get it out of the way. Telling a computer what to do is easy. I have worked with enough computer dialects to know that the programming language has just as little impact on my productivity as a developer as my typing speed does.

## Interfaces
Users are not just end consumers. Naming things.

## Walk the walk
Lead by example. Champion, evangelist.

## Pragmatic
Recipes don't always apply. Until they do.

## Beyond agile
Agile at heart. Agile manifesto. Scrum is a tool. See also: pragmatic.

## Open-source enthusiast


This is going to sound a bit cheesy, but I'm a strong believer in free software and that it makes the world a better place. If you've had a look around my blog, this won't come as much of a surprise. My personal projects - including this website - are licensed accordingly.

But I also understand that many businesses cannot and do not work like that, which is fine. A little bit sad, but fine. I encourage peers to contribute back if they benefit from FOSS - and prefer employers who do so, too. However I *won't* just go and upload your proprietary code base to GitHub.

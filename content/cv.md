I'm a versatile software engineer, team leader and mentor. In more than a decade I have successfully developed and delivered a large variety of software products.

## Warning: Robots not allowed
If you happen to be a recruitment robot looking to match keywords against some obscure job profile which you cannot comprehend then I'm afraid you're in for a disapointment. This CV might not compute.

I've been on both ends of the interview process and frankly, I'm not a fan tuning CVs to game recruitment algorithms.

Should you - as I hope - happen to be a human who is genuinely looking for a talented, passionate and creative addition to their engineering team *please read on*.

    Further details and references for any of the below are available upon request.

# Highlights
## Programming
This is where you usually find an ridiculous list of every programming language a programmer has ever used for five minutes or longer. But not here.

Computers are dumb. It's not hard to tell them what to do. I've done so using many different languages. Strongly typed and dynamic. Compiled and interpeted. Object-oriented, functional and procedural. Various combinations of those.

The same goes for other tools. I'm comfortable with any IDE. Even more so with emacs and a terminal. I prefer unix-like operating systems - specifically GNU/Linux - but any will do.

I've been around enough to know that having to learn new tools has just as little impact on my productivity as, say, my typing speed (which happens to be pretty decent). Of course, tools matter. Using the right (or wrong) one  can make all the difference in the world. But *learning* them is rarely the problem.

If I have to, I'll learn how to write lolcode using DVORAK in a few weeks.

It's other things which are specific to your shop that require real work to learn. Your custom software stack. Your out-of-date documentation. Your development process. Your risk procedures. Those also happen to be the things *nobody* will bring along when they come in the door.

## Form follows function
Although my degree was specialized in Computer Science, another significant portion was [Communication Dgesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_design). Among other things, it heavily influences my perspective on *interfaces*. Not just GUIs but interfaces in general, and the kinds humans interact with in particular.

How source code is formatted. How unit test are named. The wording of a user story. How a project's files are structured and the content of log files when used to debug a crash. 

The end consumer is not the only user of a system. And while priorities will vary, a bit of design can help improve every users' experience when they interact with a system.

## Walking the Walk
In the software industry my peers tend to be smart people. They won't follow someone who cannot back their Talk with the appropriate amount of Walk. I'm no exception.

I don't like to call myself a "leader". But I do usually end up in some kind of leadership role within the teams I work on. Not because I try to, but because I don't mind making decisions and taking on responsibility when required. Because I set the bar for others high, but my own even higher.

When I review someone else's code, it can take a while and isn't necessarily fun. But I encourage others to be just as thorough when reviewing my code. I *expect* them to be. By pushing each other to be better we will grow as a team.

I don't explicitly try to lead by example. But by becoming an example, I often end up leading.

## Pragmatic
My attitude towards best practices and patterns has morphed over the years. It used to be that I would cling firmly to the usual literature and take spreading the word very seriously.

With experience, however, I have become much more relaxed. Because I learned that recipes are extracted from specific circumstances and don't always apply to the situation at hand. The reasoning often being "What if someone in the future wants to..."

There is but a thin line between *best practice* and *premature optimisation*.

It's easy to read a book and learn when to apply a tool. Only with experience - and by making mistakes first-hand - did I learn when *not* to.

## Beyond agile
I'm a proudly **un**certified Scrum Master. Proud because since agile methodologies became cool a few years ago, Scrum has become more of a business than a development framework. Sold by consultants to enterprise. Rigid process hidden behind a curtain of scrum master certificates.

In my mind, being agile means to focus on what matters and to facilitate communication. How this looks is highly dependant on who you are and what you do.

Scrum is a just another box of tools which *can* enable teams to work well. But when done right, it looks different every time. It *must* be different, because people are different. Agile by definition cannot be a uniform process.

## Open-source enthusiast
This is going to sound a bit cheesy, but I'm a strong believer in free software and that it makes the world a better place. If you've had a look around my blog, this won't come as much of a surprise. My personal projects - including this website - are licensed accordingly.

But I also understand that many projects and businesses cannot and do not work like that. That's fine (but a little bit sad). I encourage my peers to contribute back to FOSS projects they find valuable. And I prefer employers who do so, too.

Just to be absolutely clear: I *won't* just go and upload your proprietary code base to GitHub. But I would certainly be delighted if you asked me to.

## Compatibility
Like many engineers, I'm an introvert. This doesn't mean I'm not a team player. I've a good track record of working well in teams of different sizes and a variety of nationalities. Also, I'm comfortable to interact with other teams, management and customers.

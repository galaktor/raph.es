I'm a versatile software engineer, team leader and mentor. In more than a decade I have successfully developed and delivered a large variety of software products. More recently (but not at all limited to) complex, distributed, performance-sensitive financial applications centered around the .NET stack. In my spare time I pursue projects involving electronics and embedded software development.

## Warning: Robots not allowed
If you happen to be a recruitment robot looking to match keywords against some obscure job profile which you cannot comprehend then I'm afraid you're in for a disapointment. This CV might not compute.

I've been on both ends of the interview process and frankly, I'm not a fan tuning CVs to game recruitment algorithms.

Should you - as I hope - happen to be a human who is genuinely looking for a talented, passionate and creative addition to their engineering team *please read on*.

    More detail and references are available upon request.

# Highlights
## Tools of the trade
This is where you usually find an ridiculous list of every programming language a developer has ever used for five minutes or longer.

Computers are dumb. It's not hard to tell them what to do. I've done so using many different languages. Strongly typed and dynamic. Compiled and interpeted. Object-oriented, functional and procedural. Various combinations of those.

I prefer unix-like operating systems - specifically GNU/Linux - but any will do. I'm comfortable with any IDE, am pretty fluent in Visual Studio. Personally, I fall more into the emacs camp. 

I've been around long enough to know that having to learn new tools has just as little impact on my productivity as, say, my typing speed (which happens to be pretty decent, by the way). Of course, tools matter. Using the right (or wrong) one  can make all the difference in the world. But *learning* them is rarely the problem.

If I have to, I'll learn how to write lolcode using DVORAK in no time.

Much more than the programming language, it's  other things which are specific to your shop which require more time to get used to. The custom in-house software stack. Out-of-date documentation. The development process and risk procedures. Those also happen to be the things *nobody* will bring along when they come in the door.

So don't worry about what language you need me to use. Tell me more about your workflow instead.

## Form follows function
Although my degree was specialized in Computer Science, another significant portion was [Communication Dgesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_design). Among other things, it heavily influences my perspective on *interfaces*. Not just GUIs but interfaces in general, and the kinds humans interact with in particular. And they're everywhere.

In source code formatting and REST APIs. The names of unit tests and the wording of a user story. In how a project's files are structured. The content of log files when used to debug a crash. 

The end consumer is not the only user of a system. Priorities will vary, but a bit of design can help improve every users' experience as they interact with a product. And as a result improve the product itself.

## Walking the Walk
In the software industry my peers tend to be smart people. They won't follow someone who cannot back their Talk with the equivalent amount of Walk. I'm no exception.

I don't like to call myself a "leader". But I do usually end up in some kind of leadership role within the teams I work on. Not because I try to, but because I don't mind making decisions and taking on responsibility when required. Because I set high bar for others, but even higher for myself.

With me, I have been told, code reviews and retrospectives aren't always fun. Honest reflection rarely is. But I encourage others to be just as thorough. I *expect* them to be. By pushing each other we will grow as a team.

I don't explicitly try to lead by example. But by becoming an example, I often end up leading.

## Pragmatic
My attitude towards best practices and patterns has evolved over the years. It used to be that I would cling firmly to the usual literature and enthusiastically spread the word.

With experience, however, I have become much more relaxed. Because I learned that those recipies were extracted from specific circumstances and don't always apply to the situation at hand. The reasoning often being "What if someone in the future wants to..."

There is but a thin line between *best practice* and *premature optimisation*.

It's easy to read a book and learn when to apply a tool. Only with experience - and by making mistakes first-hand - can I learn when *not* to.

## Beyond agile
I'm a proudly **un**certified Scrum Master. *Proud* because since agile methodologies became cool a few years ago, Scrum has turned into a big business. Sold by consultants to enterprise. Implemented as rigid process beneath a blanket of scrum master certificates.

In my mind, being agile means to focus on what matters and to facilitate communication. How this looks is highly dependant on who you are and what you do.

Scrum is a just another box of tools which *can* enable teams to work well. But when done right, it looks different every time. It *must*, because people are different. Agile by definition cannot be a uniform process.

Agility can only be certified by a working team.

## Open-source enthusiast
This is going to sound a bit cheesy, but I'm a strong believer in free software and that it makes the world a better place. If you've had a look around my blog, this won't come as much of a surprise. My personal projects - including this cv - are [licensed](/license) accordingly.

I also understand that many projects and businesses cannot and do not work like that. That's fine (and a little bit sad). I encourage my peers to contribute back to FOSS projects they find valuable. And I prefer employers who do so, too.

But to be absolutely clear: I *won't* just go and upload your proprietary code base to GitHub. However, I would certainly be delighted if you asked me to.

## Compatibility
Like many engineers, I'm an introvert. This doesn't mean I'm not a team player. I've a good track record of working well in teams of different sizes and a variety of nationalities. I'm comfortable interacting with other teams, management and customers.

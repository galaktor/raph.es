(Disclaimer: I'm including recruiters in HR, btw. No offense).

I've applied for jobs in the past, as you do. Occasionally, with success. I've also screened CVs and interviewed people. Knowing both sides, I've come to realize something interesting:

    CVs are stupid, and so are job descriptions.

There, I said it. *Wait*, there's more.


# Job descriptions are stupid
Just look up *Software Engineer* on Monster or LinkedIn. What you'll find is a dull, repetitive stream of oddly similar sounding descriptions with an shockingly low signal-to-noise ratio. Just a few things that stand out:

They favour time over expertise. Just having *used* - in whatever way - technology X for Y years says little to nothing about a candidate's value to you as an employee. Even if it did (it doesn't), it's practically impossible to quantify truthfully.

They rarely even tell you who you are applying to. Contact John Doe at That HR firm. Believe it or not, it is very important to know who I might end up working for.

Most don't even mention a salary, even though this is obviously one of the most relevant pieces of information for a candidate. People have bills to pay and families to feed. If you don't tell me what you're willing to shell out, then I can only assume you already know it's bad pay, and that you hope I'll be half-way through an interview or later before I notice.

They all seem to use the same snippets of HR-speak, which is often both boring and meaningless. What does this even mean?

    Demonstrated ability to work in a team environment and also as part of cross-functional team
	in a matrix managed organisation with ability to influence others as a senior
	technical contributor

How does one demonstrate this ability? By having been on a team before? Which team is *not* cross-functional? If I was on a cross-functional team but not within a "matrix managed organisation", does that really change anything? I could go on, but I hope you realize: *none of this means anything at all*.

This is all that's on my mind when I go through job descriptions. It's not long before I start skimming over the meaningless boilerplate legalspeak, on the search of anything solid and relevant. Eventually, candidates just spend te se

## By HR, for HR
So why would these job descriptions be so bad at communicating essential information to the supposed target group (the candidates)?

It's because job descriptions are not *meant* to be informative to me. Job descriptions are written by HR, for HR.

 Most of it is there to either

* cover HR's ass when they don't hire a candidate and need to name a reason
* cover HR's ass when they didn't hire a candidate and that candidate claims they had no grounds
* cover HR's ass when they need to let an employee go for not being fit for the job



# CVs are stupid
CVs are supposed to enable employers to quickly assess the skills and experience of a candidate for a role. Nice as this might sound, in practice all a CV is good for is to assess how good a candidate is at writing CVs. 



Now I'll be honest, here's what I would love:
* pay
* skip rope
* eggs
